### Say whether the following is true or false and support your answer by a proof.

$$
\begin{gathered}
(\exists m \in \mathbb{N})(\exists n \in \mathbb{N})(3m + 5n = 12)
\end{gathered}
$$

## Proof

By contradiction.

Let us assume the statement is **true**.

Therefore, $3m + 5n =12$ must hold true.

$$
\begin{aligned}
3m + 5n =12 \\
\implies 3m = 12-5n \\
\implies m = \frac{12-5n}{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

For any natural multiple of $n$, $m$ would result in a rational or an integer.

But $m \in \mathbb{N}$. **Contradiction.**

Hence, our initial assumption must be false and consequently the statement is also false.

**Q.E.D.**
