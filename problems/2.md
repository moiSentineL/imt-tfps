### Say whether the following is true or false and support your answer by a proof: The sum of any five consecutive integers is divisible by 5 (without remainder).

## Proof

We want to prove:

$$
\begin{aligned}
n + (n+1)+ (n+2)+ (n+3)+ (n+4) = 5k + 0\\
(\text{by the definition of divisibility})
\end{aligned}
$$

where $n, k \in \mathbb{Z}$.

Now, 

$$
\begin{aligned}
n + (n+1)+ (n+2)+ (n+3)+ (n+4) & = 5n + 10 \\
& = 5(n +2) + 0
\end{aligned}
$$

where $k = n+2$.

Which proves that the sum of any five consecutive integers is divisible by 5. We did it!
