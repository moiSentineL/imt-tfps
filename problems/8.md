### Prove (from the definition of a limit of a sequence) that if the sequence $\{ a_{n} \}^{\infty}_{n = 1}$ tends to limit $L$ as $n \to \infty$, then for any fixed number $M > 0$, the sequence $\{ Ma_{n} \}^{\infty}_{n = 1}$ tends to the limit $ML$.

## Proof

Let $\epsilon$ be arbitrary.

If the sequence $\{ a_{n} \}^{\infty}_{n = 1}$ tends to limit $L$ as $n \to \infty$, then:

$$
\begin{aligned}
|a_{m} - L| < \epsilon  \qquad  \text{(i)}
\end{aligned}
$$

(by the definition of a limit of a sequence).

Now, for the sequence $\{ Ma_{n} \}^{\infty}_{n = 1}$, let $\epsilon' \geq M\epsilon$.

We want to deduce:

$$
\begin{aligned}
|Ma_{m} - ML| < \epsilon'
\end{aligned}
$$

So, multiply both sides of the inequality (i) by $M$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& M|a_{m} - L| < M\epsilon \\
\implies & -M\epsilon < Ma_{m} - ML < M\epsilon  \qquad \text{(using algebra)}\\
\implies & -\epsilon ' \leq Ma_{m} - ML \leq \epsilon' 
\end{aligned}
$$

Which is what we wanted to deduce.

And which, by the definition of the limit, means $Ma_{m} \to ML$ as $n \to \infty$ for the sequence $\{ Ma_{n} \}^{\infty}_{n = 1}$, 

Hence, the statement is true. $\blacksquare$
