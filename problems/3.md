### Say whether the following is true or false and support your answer by a proof: For any integer $n$, $n^{2} + n + 1$ is odd.

## Proof

By mathematical induction.

Let $A(n)$ denote the statement "$n^{2} + n + 1$ is odd".

For $n =1$, (**Hypothesis step**)

$$
\begin{gathered}
(1)^{2} + 1+ 1= 3 \text{ (odd)}
\end{gathered}
$$

Therefore, $A(1)$ is true.

Now, we want to deduce:

$$
\begin{gathered}
(n+1)^{2} + (n+1) +1
\end{gathered}
$$


Assuming $A(n)$ is true, add $2(n+1)$ to our initial expression. (**Induction step**)

$$
\begin{aligned}
n^{2} + n+1 + 2(n+1) & = n^{2} + n + 1 + 2n + 2 \\
& = n^{2} + 1 + 2n + n + 1 + 1 \qquad (\text{algebra}) \\
& = (n+1)^{2} + (n+1) + 1 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Which is the expression for $A(n+1)$.

This follows that $A(n)$ is valid.

Hence, **by the principle of mathematical induction**, the statement is proven true.
