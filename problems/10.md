### Given an example of a family of intervals  $A_{n}, n = 1, 2, 3 \dots$ such that $A_{n+1} \subset A_{n}$ for all $n$ and $\bigcap^{\infty}_{n=1} A_{n}$ consists of a single real number. Prove that your example has the stated property.

## Proof

The family is $\left[ 0, \frac{1}{n} \right]$

We have two conditions to prove:

1. $A_{n+1} \subset A_{n}$
2. $\bigcap^{\infty}_{n=1} A_{n} = k$ where $k \in \mathbb{R}$

### For condition 1

We need to show that for any $n$, the $n+1 ^{\text{th}}$ interval is smaller than the $n^{th}$ interval but also a subset, to prove the first condition.

We do so by taking an arbitrary $n$.

Then, the interval $\left[ 0, \frac{1}{n+1} \right]$ is smaller than $\left[ 0, \frac{1}{n} \right]$, but a subset ($\because \frac{1}{n+1} < \frac{1}{n}$).

Similarly, the interval $\left[ 0, \frac{1}{n+2} \right]$ is smaller than $\left[ 0, \frac{1}{n+1} \right]$, but a subset.

Therefore, $\forall n[A_{n+1} \subset A_{n}]$. **This proves the first condition.**

### For condition 2

We know that as $n \to \infty$, $\frac{1}{n} \to 0$. So $\left[ 0, \frac{1}{n} \right] \to [0, 0]$, which is the last possible interval in the family.

And since $[0, 0] = \{ 0 \}$, the intersection of the family is also $\{ 0 \}$, because $[0, 0]$ is the last interval in the family.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\bigcap^{\infty}_{n = 1} A_{n} = \{ 0 \}
\end{aligned}
$$

Which is a single real number. **And this proves the second condition.**

Hence, the family $[0, \frac{1}{n}]$ suffices both the conditions, which is what we wanted to prove.
