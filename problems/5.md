### Prove that for any integer $n$, at least one of the integers $n, n + 2, n + 4$ is divisible by 3.

## Proof

By the method of cases.

There arises two cases: a) $n$ is divisible by 3, and b) $n$ is not divisible by 3.

a) If $3|n$, then claim is proven true.

b) If not $3|n$, then 

$$
\begin{aligned}
n = 3q + 1 \space\text{ (i)} \quad \text{or} \quad n = 3q + 2 \space \text{ (ii)} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

where $q \in \mathbb{Z}$. (By the definition of divisibility.)

Now, add $2$ to both the sides of the equation (i)

$$
\begin{aligned}
n +2 & =3q + 1 +2 \\
& = 3q+ 3 \\
n+2 & = 3(q+1) +0
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, by the definition of divisibility, **$n+2$ is divisible by 3.** 

Similarly, add $4$ to both the sides of equation (ii)

$$
\begin{aligned}
n +4 & =3q + 2 +4 \\
& = 3q+ 6 \\
n+4 & = 3(q+2) +0
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, by the definition of divisibility, **$n+4$ is divisible by 3.**

Hence, in any case, at least one of the integers $n, n+2, n+4$ is divisible by 3, which is what we wanted to prove.
