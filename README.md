My Solutions for Test Flight Problem Set for the Introduction to Mathematical Thinking course.

**Please do not read until you have submitted the problem set yourself.**

## Workflow

I wrote all the proofs in `markdown` + LaTeX, in my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault and later exported them to `pdf`s using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). I used a Python script (`makepdf.py`) to help me do so.

- Markdown files are available at `problems/`.
